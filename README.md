# Power-BI-PwC-Dashboards-
This repository contains the dashboards I worked on during my virtual internship experience with PwC Switzerland. <br>
The first dashboard shows the call center trends by focusing on the visualization of customers and agents' behaviors. <br>
The second dashboard contains different visuals about the customers' demographics and insights that aim to give management the information needed to better retain customers. <br>
Finally, the last dashboard focuses on diversity and inclusion by giving insights on the gender effect within the company.
